Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Liz Truss is "a very good prime minister" and she should "absolutely not" resign.

The business secretary spoke to journalists as he arrived at Downing Street this evening ahead of a drinks reception the prime minister is holding to reassure her cabinet.

Guests seen entering No 10 also included Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt and chief whip Wendy Morton, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman, among others.
