Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ditched almost all of PM Liz Truss's tax cuts announced in the government's mini-budget three weeks ago
He addressed MPs and taking questions about the latest economic U-turns by the government
Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt earlier stood in for the PM - who she said was attending urgent business - during a debate
Truss later attended the Commons to hear the chancellor's emergency statement to MPs
This morning, Hunt announced the basic rate of income tax would remain at 20p indefinitely - instead of being cut
And the cap on energy prices charged to households is now only guaranteed until April next year
But cuts to stamp duty and National Insurance remain in place, and the cap on bankers' bonuses will still be scrapped
